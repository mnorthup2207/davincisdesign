                        Every
                        tube has been designed for the exact stiffness, strength, weight and ride characteristic we are
                        seeking, nothing is off the shelf. We had custom dies made for every tube and the results were
                        well
                        worth it. And, every daVinci tandem has the patented Independent Coasting System (ICS).</p>

                        Customers tell us their da Vinci rides more like a single than any other tandem they have
                        ridden. We attribute the ride quality to the race proven geometry, large diameter tubing,
                        careful placement, laser straight alignment and flawless construction..</p>
